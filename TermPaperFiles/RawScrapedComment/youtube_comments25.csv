UC8WdKsMkzIByX9egl1UixAg;@and4828;If Devin is ready to replace everyone then get Devin to develop a better version of itself (maybe ad infinitum)‚Ä¶.and then sell that as Devin‚Äôs replacement. üòÇ good luck with that. Maybe the company that is developing Devin will soon fire all its own engineers‚Ä¶.üòÇ and just have Devin continually self improving itself in a basement somewhere üòÇ.;2024-03-21T12:08:21Z;0;

UCloKRhleXPZpyqcuh_enAAA;@11junkyard;"The issue is that a lot of people are being shortsighted and attribute inability to work on the nuances and intricacies of software development  to current models of LLM&#39;s and the few demo&#39;s they&#39;ve seen of Devin (which is probably built as a wrapper over GPT 4) and think that AI is just one entity which won&#39;t be able to manage those things effectively. The paradigm will (in as soon as a few months) will and is shifting to optimizing AI for agentic tasks and system 2 thinking (research on Q*) which WILL indeed be able to handle a lot of these nuances and intricacies much much effectively with every new iteration over the coming years.";2024-03-21T03:17:55Z;0;
