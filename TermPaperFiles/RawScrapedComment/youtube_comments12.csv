UCYLm7mko_dJaGLVJdTJ2-zA;@headofmyself5663;Countries with the highest level of automation tend to have the lowest unemployement rates. Besides, it needs a lot of effort to make AI systems work. In supervised learning for industrial image computation for example, you need expert knowledge about the processes for labeling and verification in order to improve your models. Therefore, jobs like data curators will occur imho. The skill sets will be different and i would guess that education will be the key. Mindless work will be automated but new jobs are created. Prompt engineering maybe also a good example, since it actually need skills to ask the right questions and also the ability to understand the answers to verify properly their correctness.
