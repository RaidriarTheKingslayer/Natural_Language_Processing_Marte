Ele enfatiza que muitos projetos de IA s√£o caros devido √† necessidade de engenheiros altamente qualificados, tornando-os inacess√≠veis para a maioria. No entanto, Andrew sugere que novas plataformas de desenvolvimento de IA est√£o surgindo, simplificando o processo e permitindo que pessoas comuns criem sistemas de IA personalizados usando dados. Ele acredita que democratizar o acesso √† IA √© fundamental para espalhar a riqueza que a IA pode gerar pela sociedade.<br><br>### Destaques<br>- üìö Compara√ß√£o da ascens√£o da IA com a ascens√£o da literacia na sociedade.<br>- üíº Concentra√ß√£o da IA nas grandes empresas de tecnologia.<br>- üí∞ Custo elevado e necessidade de engenheiros qualificados para projetos de IA.<br>- üçï Exemplo de uma pizzaria local que poderia se beneficiar da IA.<br>- üìä O potencial da IA em pequenos neg√≥cios, como fabricantes de camisetas.<br>- üåê Plataformas emergentes que simplificam o desenvolvimento de IA.<br>- ü§ñ Democratiza√ß√£o do acesso √† IA para permitir que mais pessoas criem sistemas personalizados.<br>- üí° A vis√£o de um futuro empolgante onde todos podem construir sistemas de IA.";2023-09-18T05:16:08Z;0;
