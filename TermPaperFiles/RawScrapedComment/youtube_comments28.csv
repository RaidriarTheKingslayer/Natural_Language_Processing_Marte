UCQD4UW8YL07T7BQSITmN6XQ;@RodrigoRocha1980;"### Resumo<br>Nesta palestra do TED, Andrew Ng discute como a inteligência artificial (IA) pode empoderar qualquer negócio, destacando a concentração atual da IA nas grandes empresas de tecnologia e a necessidade de expandir seu uso para pequenas empresas e indivíduos. Ele enfatiza que muitos projetos de IA são caros devido à necessidade de engenheiros altamente qualificados, tornando-os inacessíveis para a maioria. No entanto, Andrew sugere que novas plataformas de desenvolvimento de IA estão surgindo, simplificando o processo e permitindo que pessoas comuns criem sistemas de IA personalizados usando dados. Ele acredita que democratizar o acesso à IA é fundamental para espalhar a riqueza que a IA pode gerar pela sociedade.<br><br>### Destaques<br>- 📚 Comparação da ascensão da IA com a ascensão da literacia na sociedade.<br>- 💼 Concentração da IA nas grandes empresas de tecnologia.<br>- 💰 Custo elevado e necessidade de engenheiros qualificados para projetos de IA.<br>- 🍕 Exemplo de uma pizzaria local que poderia se beneficiar da IA.<br>- 📊 O potencial da IA em pequenos negócios, como fabricantes de camisetas.<br>- 🌐 Plataformas emergentes que simplificam o desenvolvimento de IA.<br>- 🤖 Democratização do acesso à IA para permitir que mais pessoas criem sistemas personalizados.<br>- 💡 A visão de um futuro empolgante onde todos podem construir sistemas de IA.";2023-09-18T05:16:08Z;0;
