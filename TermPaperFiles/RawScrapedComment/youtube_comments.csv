UCizlqA8o4_mqMWNxDdqRcXQ;@KatharineOsborne;"As a software developer who has been unemployed for the last 8 months (I&#39;ve never had a job search take more than a couple of months), I would NOT recommend transitioning into dev, especially web dev. Maybe ML engineering is a safer bet, but the market is currently flooded with candidates in web development. And I do think software development is at high risk of AI simply because AI coding tools have already been widely adopted. It won&#39;t replace all software developers but it will make developers more efficient so fewer will be doing more.";2024-03-07T14:56:37Z;566;
