It even included a nice strawman against Libertarians.<br>Humans fundamentally don&#39;t like doing repetitive tasks. Its why factory work is unpopular. To address this, we created automation in the factory. This increased the productivity of one worker, increased the quality of the end product, and reduced the monotony of the work.<br>AI right now lacks any creative capacity. It may be able to collage what someone inputs, but it can&#39;t come up with its own ideas. When we think about AI like this, then it&#39;s more a productivity tool for a workforce that has largely not had productivity gains over the last several decades. If I used Visual Studio CoPilot, I could program ten or more times faster and produce better code. But it&#39;s not like AI will know what the entire software is until a person tells it what it is. It reduces the need for coders to rewrite the same code for different clients. This extends into other fields like finance and media art.<br>With that said, AI means less workers needed within those fields but a higher compensation for those who remain. Right now, the country is grossly lacking in manual labor and many in manual labor fields make salaries competitive with tech workers.";2023-12-19T02:32:38Z;0;
