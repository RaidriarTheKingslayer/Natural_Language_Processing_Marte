UCH1nzxQtCYMI4dl-MMMTWMA;@vsolyomi;"Well, my worthless prediction is - AI will automate a certain degree of white collar jobs, and will create new jobs, for one there will be more demand for QA to validate and verify whatever that LLM would hallucinate into existence and you probably don&#39;t want to give it to another hallucinating LLM completely. And then it will stop until next tech breakthrough, for 6 months or 10 years, who knows. As for blue collars - it might replace way bigger percentage of that but there will be a need for more technicians to maintain the iRobots. The safest jobs are probably human to human not because it&#39;s impossible, it totally is, AI scores better on empathy than humans and is immune to burnout.
