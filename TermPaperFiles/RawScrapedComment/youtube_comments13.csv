UCnWtLwl4ENJyYTX7fC-CI5w;@NikoKun;"The thing about AI, that makes it different from past forms of automation, is this time we&#39;re automating human cognition, rather than merely strength or speed.. At some point, it&#39;s intelligence, capabilities and value to businesses, will outweigh that of humans who used to work those jobs. While a few new jobs may be created, they&#39;ll be a for a small minority, NOT the masses who&#39;ll be displaced by AI! There simply won&#39;t be enough jobs to go around for everyone, and we need to start redesigning our society, to remove jobs from the justifications for how we distribute basic resources to people. Plus, AI took years of data and content from everyone, to train it, so it should benefit everyone.

Take this video for example, stock clips and images are inserted to fill in the gaps between real and archival footage. They are unrelated, repetitive, yet we tolerate it because of the illusion of continuity the medium of video has.

UCvWG-YYjMixk243wL7A6uTA;@DjBydLo;It is extremely problematic how robotization replaced human jobs since many years ago: in the 40`s if you wish to dance you had to pay to 4 people, nowadays you dont hire any one. In the 70`s someone said: **come on, this drum machines wont replace human beings because it sounds innatural**, turns out that in the 80`s that robotic sound was fashionable. With singin and autotune happened the same leaving jobless to real singers. At the end the only thing that prevails is lowering cost. But what about quality? Does anyone thinks that we produce the same quality than, lets say: Frank Sinatra singin with a full orchestra? Does anyone think that rappers and voice percussionist are real musicians or only a form of adaptaion that some people took to survive in a world without work for artists? Quality was destroyed by lowering cost. Beside, from an economical point of view, AI will mutiply the supply of art, lowering cost to a point where no human labour would be able to re-reproduce the work.;2024-01-08T18:40:21Z;0;
