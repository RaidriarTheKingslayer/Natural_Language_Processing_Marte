Its is making us more productive by finding answering a bit faster than searching via stackoverflow threads. It only knows information thats out there. It is not generating anything new.

UCRd-jhjyciqem7an7xu1frw;@jmg9509;@@sixstanger00 Absolutely spot on. If anything, it will free up creativity and brain power for us to focus on more important and interesting matters like expanding our civilization beyond earth, exploring the depths of the galaxy and even the depths of our own seas.<br><br>Edit: Also even brain power can be focused on expanding our being and life expectancy / disease.

UCfxzZS74Nl7MOeygqL-vrPQ;@polaris1985;Offsourcing to different countries is the thing that will be hit the hardest, why would you need more software engineers if the current ones can do the work of 3 or 5 with the help of AI so countries like India are going to suffer as they get a lot of that software outsourcing, similary in manufacturing if you have robots and advanced automation you can just produce cheaply with 1/10th the workers and so again manufacting outsourced countries like China and Vietnam will be hit hardest.;2024-04-14T00:57:38Z;0;

UCJJNbuwIoKIgQ68VJ4Py1DA;@wolfrain8898;"Soon enough most people will not have jobs it may take 20 years but it&#39;s coming. along with a UBI making stocks almost meaningless. we will view people with jobs the way we see someone with a big net worth today. look what you will have is a lot of small businesses owned and operated by one person or a small group of people with no need for stock holders at all so in short the stock market is going to crash like worse than it did in 1929 an this time its very unlikely it will ever recover. China is going through that right now they just don&#39;t have the jobs for people to do. an there not getting proper support by the ccp and soon enough it will be everywhere. this guy is right AGI will be able to do everything a human can in most cases so what is left for people to do other than being consumers mostly nothing. it will be a world of overabundance only limited by government control. I can easy see them putting limits of one house per person and limits on how much you can buy at the store in food and how many cars you can have per person same for planes and other things an people trying to change the limits to get more will be viewed as people who are more or less wasting there time in the long run. if we live long enough we will have people living off planet just so they can have way more inside a dome on mars or Venus say you can have  5 acres of land on Earth vs having 100 acres on Mars or Venus that has an earth like environment with there own rules vs being up under the thumb of a government that will be a wild world of possibilities. it will be almost like the old west on those planets and Earth will become a well controlled place with no room for people that party to hard.";2024-04-04T08:43:22Z;0;
UCdHzFmBBfM49-xAQrw6OoPg;@junk_rig_sailor1698;For those saying UBI is the answer, if AI takes over the worlds jobs, as it will one day - then there is no one paying tax so that means no UBI.  The Ponzi scheme that Capitalism is, is about to collapse in on itself.  Capitalism only works for people when people are working, spend their money on goods and services, and pay tax to the government.  If AI does all the jobs - capitalism is over.
