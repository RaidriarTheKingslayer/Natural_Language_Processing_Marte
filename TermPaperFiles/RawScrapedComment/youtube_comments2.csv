You might work harder than everyone in your department, but that&#39;s no guarantee you&#39;ll keep your job. If you work in retail, it might make sense from the business&#39; point-of-view to have someone young and pretty instead. Maybe the person doing the hiring just fancies the 21-year-old more than they do you, even if they&#39;re lazy and unqualified.";2024-04-30T08:37:42Z;0;UCiYlEf7SC0Mqq5yBZEa217g
UCiYlEf7SC0Mqq5yBZEa217g;@miken7629;@@jamesgravil9162 You have a point, corporations tend to layoff people when they reach 50 which is too old to get a job, that is why people need to save and build enough wealth to retire by 50.  I made it to 56 before I was laid off but I built $1.55 million to retire.;2024-04-30T12:55:53Z;0;UCiYlEf7SC0Mqq5yBZEa217g
