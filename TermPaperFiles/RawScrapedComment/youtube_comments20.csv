And why are people very much bothered about ai.. nothing to worry atleast for about 200 years.. because in 1900 tech was so good..  everyone assumed we will do intergalactic travel.. by 2020...  Today my foot.. humans lost creativity.. and creativity is no more... Rules regulations killed everything.... It&#39;s unlikely that ai will be employed everywhere... Soon rules will come to remove ai completely from existence...  History is proof..  all problems are just temporary...";2024-04-13T05:38:42Z;0;

UCUB6baFW4kvLsLzlZ-kp5Ug;@stephanieellison7834;"AI and its Impact on Society<br><br>Oct 31, 2023, updated on April 11, 2024<br><br>We must ask ourselves, &quot;What will happen when AI has taken 85% of jobs present in 2020?  What will we do?  How will we eat and survive without incomes from jobs or other means?&quot;  What is disturbing is that while AI is taking these jobs, the gov&#39;t and the corporations have not done ANYTHING to prepare us for an AI&#39;ed civilization.  They have not said anything about major retraining of an entire economy to something else, and they have not followed up on a discussion of universal basic income.  This is supposedly supported by a lack of information in the latest government budgets submitted and approved as reported by some YouTube videos.<br><br>It appears that the US gov&#39;t and the corporations intend to kill off the majority of Americans passively, through starvation from lack of income to buy food.  (check and see if farming production is declining or will start to decline ahead of the &quot;starvation phase&quot;)  (also check to see if the &quot;makeup&quot; of robot equipment allocation would change to reflect a trend away from retail and services for the masses, possibly indicating an extinction of the American public - this means taking a robot from Chipotle and repurposing it for some other job not related to the public, or scrapping affected robots to be remade for some other purpose that has nothing to do with the public)  It appears that the decline of farming has already started with the state of Maine buying farm land under the pretext that there are &quot;forever chemicals&quot; present at around 20 parts per TRILLION (safe level is said to be only 4 parts per TRILLION), which does not make sense, BUT this would rope in a LOT of land across the US.  Other states may follow suit in addition to the ten states that have similar laws in place.<br><br>This way, there are only enough people alive to get some things done, and the rest is done by AI, and the survivors who planned this can claim the whole country for themselves.  Imagine having an estate mansion half the size of a mall on several dozen thousand acres of land, and robots would be used to maintain and clean the estates and do the farming FOR THE ESTATE OWNERS.  The White Man&#39;s wet dream of civilization.  What will the Native Americans south of the US border do when they see this coming, especially when they can buy firearms legally now?  Hopi prophecy...";2024-04-13T03:31:08Z;0;
