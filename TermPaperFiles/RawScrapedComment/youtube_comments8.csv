UCtPzMcSTkHlHeQMutEVeaEg;@tradfluteman;CS professors are in a special category of people that can be tricked by the current wave of AI, since they specialize in teaching broadly-known CS concepts, which AI excels at regurgitating and repackaging. Remember, large language models are great at two things: impressing us and letting us down. They impress us when we think up problems on the spot for them to solve (because we are not very creative), and they let us down when we allow the real world to come up with the problems (because we <b>*are*</b> very resourceful). Only trust a CS professor on this topic if they are actively using AI to assist them in experimental work.;2024-01-29T16:36:48Z;1;

UCG1As8b1yQVC6NpeAGW4dJQ;@ChessSniper;My concern with AI and a rebuttal to your argument is that every time there has been a significant technological leap that increases productivity it tends to be used by capitalist as a way to leverage it against labor.<br><br>Typically the responsibilities for the employees increases while the salaries decrease. If anything, the push for automation in fast-food is a reaction to COVID, and how the labor market decided that they needed to demand a living wage if it was worth going back to a monotonous job.<br><br>AI is not really the problem, the problem is the public policies that will regulate the relationship between employers and employees.
