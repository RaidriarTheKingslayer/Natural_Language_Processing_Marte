UCovZsuww3dgh_rWOzmFDAWQ;@mwj5368;"What about County Human Services Social Workers? I called my Social Worker to leave a voicemail and his recording was he returns calls within 25 days. Nothing ever happened. I called about 10 days ago and now his recording sends callers in a circle and makes it impossible to leave a voice mail. It was a major effort as city bus lines due to my location are not a good connection to get to the County offices so I go by bicycle and delivered a tangible message that I also think will never be answered. Are Social Workers jobs going to be in serious danger with AI in any way? Even with the way things are for their workload I hope that doesn&#39;t happen. Any input is much appreciated. Thanks for your very informative video, a magnanimous deed!";2024-02-24T21:26:01Z;0;
UCwc6eOFpUPNPwoy1v222scA;@mmoya1135;I work in tech and I’ve tried using chatGPT. It is helpful but it’s not to the point that it will replace me. It’s nice for easy stuff you don’t want to waste time coding up but it doesn’t understand complicated nuanced systems. It’s not going to stand up a distributed system for you, it’s okay at terraform but it’s not going to stand up your infrastructure,etc. One could argue it might replace low level SWEs but even that’s a stretch. I’d rather ramp someone up to take on those tasks than rely on chatGPT. I normally watch your content but this is definitely fear mongering during a time that a lot of people in tech have been laid off, not cool;2024-02-24T21:07:59Z;0;

UC8vE-KYtQLcvmg_WvcIBnWw;@m.s.1421;"AI can replace workers but it cannot replace customers. If millions of people loose their jobs because of AI, who will the CEOs sell their products and services to? Without thinking about the social disorder. AI is just a tool, the problem is always the same: an economici system based on making the biggest profit every single year using any legal (often also illegal) instrument. If anybody else here were a CEO, they would behave in the same way because a CEO&#39;s job is to maximize the profit.";2024-02-24T12:03:44Z;0;

UC8K8hZZIE8pWH6hUDd7FqHg;@AY-dw4om;The problem with what you present is your are not a computer science educated, so your assumption about what CHAT GPT can and cannot do are wrong. It is a tool, can do may things, can improve a production process for a human using it and save a lot of time, BUT, it cannot think for it self what so ever. that is a mile stone we will reach in a very distant future, not now, not close.;2024-02-23T21:25:06Z;0;
