UCvWG-YYjMixk243wL7A6uTA;@DjBydLo;It is extremely problematic how robotization replaced human jobs since many years ago: in the 40`s if you wish to dance you had to pay to 4 people, nowadays you dont hire any one. In the 70`s someone said: **come on, this drum machines wont replace human beings because it sounds innatural**, turns out that in the 80`s that robotic sound was fashionable. With singin and autotune happened the same leaving jobless to real singers. At the end the only thing that prevails is lowering cost. But what about quality? Does anyone thinks that we produce the same quality than, lets say: Frank Sinatra singin with a full orchestra? Does anyone think that rappers and voice percussionist are real musicians or only a form of adaptaion that some people took to survive in a world without work for artists? Quality was destroyed by lowering cost. Beside, from an economical point of view, AI will mutiply the supply of art, lowering cost to a point where no human labour would be able to re-reproduce the work.;2024-01-08T18:40:21Z;0;;It is extremely problematic how colonization replaced human jobs since many years ago in the 40 .if you wish to dance you had to pay to 4 people, nowadays, you do not hire anyone.
