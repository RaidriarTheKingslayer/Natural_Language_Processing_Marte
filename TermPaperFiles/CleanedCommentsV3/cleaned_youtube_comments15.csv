Being a programmer myself, I can clearly see from his code where he struggles to understand concepts and the inner workings of the language (we are talking about basic stuff like OOP concepts, passing functions to functions, selectors, constructors, etc.). Well, enter ChatGPT. My brother jumped on the bandwagon day 1. He had a lot of code written in his application by ChatGPT. Amazing, right? Dead wrong. The code ChatGPT wrote, even though it was quite basic &amp; easy, my brother for the life of him could not get his head around it. He just kept trying to make it work using more ChatGPT prompts, but couldn&#39;t. He was stuck in this perpetual loop of not being able to understand what is wrong or what is even written in front of him and trying, hoping that ChatGPT will make it right. You see the problem here? He wasn&#39;t learning by exploring how to do stuff on his own, he wasn&#39;t experienced enough to understand even the basic stuff ChatGPT wrote for him. I cut him off of this cursed needle right there and then.

I have a brother who is going through university in the computer engineering field. Being a programmer myself, I can clearly see from his code where he struggles to understand concepts and the inner workings of the language we are talking about basic stuff like OOP concepts, passing functions to functions, selectors, constructors, etc. . Well, enter ChatGPT. My brother jumped on the bandwagon day 1. He had a lot of code written in his application by ChatGPT. Amazing, right? Dead wrong. The code ChatGPT wrote, even though it was quite basic easy, my brother for the life of him could not get his head around it. He just kept trying to make it work using more ChatGPT prompts, but could not . He was stuck in this perpetual loop of not being able to understand what is wrong or what is even written in front of him and trying, hoping that ChatGPT will make it right. You see the problem here?
