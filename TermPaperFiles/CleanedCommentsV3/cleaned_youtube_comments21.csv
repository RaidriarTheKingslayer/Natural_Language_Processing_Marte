China is going through that right now they just don&#39;t have the jobs for people to do. an there not getting proper support by the ccp and soon enough it will be everywhere. this guy is right AGI will be able to do everything a human can in most cases so what is left for people to do other than being consumers mostly nothing. it will be a world of overabundance only limited by government control. I can easy see them putting limits of one house per person and limits on how much you can buy at the store in food and how many cars you can have per person same for planes and other things an people trying to change the limits to get more will be viewed as people who are more or less wasting there time in the long run. if we live long enough we will have people living off planet just so they can have way more inside a dome on mars or Venus say you can have  5 acres of land on Earth vs having 100 acres on Mars or Venus that has an earth like environment with there own rules vs being up under the thumb of a government that will be a wild world of possibilities. it will be almost like the old west on those planets and Earth will become a well controlled place with no room for people that party to hard.";2024-04-04T08:43:22Z;0;;Soon enough most people will not have jobs it may take 20 years but it .coming.
