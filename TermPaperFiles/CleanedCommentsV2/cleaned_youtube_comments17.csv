UCIR1x2hc-xWspdxg6NvYKMQ;@roninatlanta;"So, about thirty years ago I asked the question (at a Business Round Table meeting)...&#39;How does the economy function without a wage earning workforce?&#39; Robots and AI don&#39;t earn wages. Robots and AI don&#39;t buy goods and services. Robots and AI don&#39;t contribute to 401ks (which fuel a significant amount of the investment industry.) Robots and AI don&#39;t buy homes or rent apartments. Robots and AI don&#39;t buy cars and trucks. Robots and AI don&#39;t buy medical services. Robots and AI don&#39;t need insurance. Robots and AI don&#39;t buy education services. And Robots and AI don&#39;t pay taxes since they&#39;re not wage earners. So, when Robots and AI replace wage earning and tax paying workers how will the economy function? Where will money come from? Will businesses be forced to share their income and profits with the populace? And since the marketplace&#39;s buying power will be lessened, how will income and profits be generated? A lot to think about. How does a natural economy function with an unnatural workforce?";2024-03-10T14:47:12Z;309;;So, about thirty years ago I asked at a Business Round Table meeting ...
