And then it will stop until next tech breakthrough, for 6 months or 10 years, who knows. As for blue collars - it might replace way bigger percentage of that but there will be a need for more technicians to maintain the iRobots. The safest jobs are probably human to human not because it&#39;s impossible, it totally is, AI scores better on empathy than humans and is immune to burnout.
